### 👋 Hey there

I work on **making software predictable**.

That usually means:
- automating what matters
- testing where it hurts most
- pushing quality earlier into the pipeline

I’ve spent the last **7+ years** working across **Web, API, and AI-driven systems**, building automation frameworks and integrating them into CI/CD so teams can move fast *without breaking things*.

---

### 🧠 Things I care about

✔ Automation that survives refactors  
✔ APIs that fail loudly (before production does)  
✔ CI/CD pipelines that act as quality gates  
✔ Performance tested before users complain  
✔ Mentoring junior QAs into confident engineers  

---

### 🛠 Tools I actually use

Java            → Selenium, TestNG, RestAssured  
Python          → Pytest, requests  
CI/CD           → Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
Performance     → JMeter, Locust  
Infra & OS      → Docker, AWS, Linux  
Data            → SQL  

(no buzzwords, just what I use day-to-day)

---

### 📦 Repositories you’ll find here

- Hybrid automation frameworks (UI + API)
- API regression & validation setups
- CI/CD-integrated test pipelines
- Performance testing utilities

Most repos are built from **real problems**, not tutorial demos.

---

### 🧪 Current experiments

- Improving automation reliability in CI
- Smarter API failure detection
- Making regression suites faster without losing signal

### 📊 GitHub activity (because numbers exist)

### ☕ Outside the code

I enjoy:
- simplifying complex QA problems
- clean test architecture
- calm releases
- helping juniors grow

Quality is not a department — it’s a system property.
